    <pre>Better Together 
        “There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
        No song that I could sing, but I can try for your heart
        Our dreams, and they are made out of real things
        Like a shoebox of photographs
        With sepia-toned loving.
        
        “Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart
        Like why are we here? And where do we go?
        And how come it's so hard?
        It's not always easy and
        Sometimes life can be deceiving
        I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together.”</pre>
